I love learning. I love it so much that I continue to seek it out, year after year. I enjoy feeling empowered. I suppose I could say I'm becoming literate in many different things. Since finishing grad school, I have taken classes and lessons in the following:

- swimming
- riding a bicycle
- swing dancing (lots of classes!)
- ballroom dancing  (waltz)
- salsa dancing
- African dance
- Brazilian dance
- sewing
- sewing and fitting
- technical writing (I'm in the last course of the certificate program right now!)

I would love to take painting, drawing, and ceramics classes one day. I've never taken an art class, but I think it would be marvelous.

I think focusing on experiencing life fully and expanding your boundaries helps with writing. Writing can involve looking at things very closely and noting minute details, just as you do when you are learning.
