I believe it's important to continue to develop skills and to learn. Learning keeps the mind sharp, and there's a sense of accomplishment in developing new skills. I love learning how to do new things (and how to do them well).

Recently, I've rekindled my interest in learning more about web development.

I started learning HTML when I was in high school, but stopped after entering college and switching majors. A few years ago, I attended several [New Orleans Women in Technology](http://neworleanswit.org/) "learn to code" workshops and started learning about (the more modern version of) HTML and CSS, but I stopped again, due to moving and changing jobs.

Now, I've started learning more about HTML and CSS on my own, using online resources. I started the process recently and have learned some basics about HTML, using the [W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) that a friend recommended. I took the exam to measure my progress; I [passed](https://certification.w3schools.com/w3certified.asp?id=10136467) on the first attempt. That's a good start, but I know there's more.

My next steps involve learning more about HTML and everything about CSS. Eventually, I want to have the skills that would allow me to build a useful, responsive, and [accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/) website.
