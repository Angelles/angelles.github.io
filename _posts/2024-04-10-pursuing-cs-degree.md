It's been almost a year since I last posted. What have I been up to? I've been pursuing a degree in computer science.

## Why computer science?

I think it's interesting. I enjoy writing programs, problem solving, and troubleshooting. I feel a sense of achievement I get when I complete or fix something. I want to know *more* about the fundamentals and patterns that underlie all applications. I learned a lot about specific software products as a technical writer; I want to understand the broader context.

## What I've learned so far

The courses I have taken thus far have covered:
- Java
- Python
- Object-oriented programming

I am currently taking courses that cover:
- C
- Shell scripting
- Swift and iOS app development

I will be taking a course that covers data structures and algorithms in the near future. I'm excited to learn more.
