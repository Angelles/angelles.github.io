I'm currently working on learning Java. I want to be the best technical writer I can be. A few of the ways I think I can be more effective include:

- Being able to read code as easily as I can read a passage written in English
- Being able to understand the underlying logic and patterns of a commonly-used language, so that I can apply that same understanding to new languages as needed

I welcome information about learning resources and coding/technology groups, especially those for BIPOC or women/femme folks.
