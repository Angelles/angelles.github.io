I've recently developed an interest in learning more about user experience (UX) design. I decided to start by taking an online, non-credit introductory course ([link to certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/P5DVJFXYHSYF?utm_medium=certificate&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate&utm_term=long)).Â  I think I'll read a book about the topic next. I welcome any book and online resource recommendations!
