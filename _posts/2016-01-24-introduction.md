I am Angelle Leger, and this is my professional website. My life is multifaceted, but on this website, I will be focusing on writing: writing itself, editing, proofreading, teaching writing, and writing coaching or tutoring.

Until very recently, I worked as a coordinator for a writing center, which involved many things: tutoring students, training tutors, designing instructional materials for students and training materials for tutors, compiling writing center data, writing reports, doing writing skills workshops and presentations, and so on. It was incredibly fulfilling work. I got to talk about the writing process all day; moreover, I helped people to become better, more confident writers.

Previously, I worked in a writing center as an instructional assistant; I also taught first-year English composition. This was also fulfilling work, as I worked with students in two capacities: as an instructor, and as academic support. This meant that after class, students could come to the writing center and talk with me at length (and in depth) about their writing.

I have been writing for such a long time that I don't even remember when I started taking it more seriously. I wrote for a satirical newspaper for a few months; I wrote for my college's student paper before I started graduate school. I've written countless poems and many essays. I maintain a blog about sewing.

I love the entire writing process, from brainstorming to proofreading. For people who don't share that love, I am happy to help them through the process, whether it is as a writing coach or as an editor.

That is the synopsis of my work/writing life.
