I recently visited a friend who was working on creating a part of one of her parade costumes. She was working on making boot covers and wanted to create a custom pattern from her measurements. I volunteered to help her with the patterning and ended up with a technical writing moment.

We used the method that Colleen Cosplay describes in her video [DIY Cosplay Boot Covers Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7egpHPTLbQ&ab_channel=ColleenCosplay) to create the pattern. 

# Technical writing enters the scene

As we were working on the patterning together, it occurred to me that it would be helpful for my friend to have a set of written steps that covered not only the patterning steps, but the cutting, sewing, fitting, and finishing steps as well. I started writing down the steps as we worked. I told myself that I would keep the steps brief.

The next day, I looked at the steps and thought to myself, *You know what would make this better? Section headings and links to external resources that provide more context about the sewing terms and methods I'm describing in the next.* Next thing you know, I've written a multi-page document with multiple note callouts and a list of required materials. I wanted to make sure that every step would be clear for my friend, who is at the beginning of her sewing journey, yes, but also, I fully got into the flow of writing the steps out! 

I've included the process below. I enjoyed writing these steps so much.

# How to make boot covers

<p class="callout-info">This how-to is based on the method Colleen Cosplay describes in her video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7egpHPTLbQ&ab_channel=ColleenCosplay" target="_blank">DIY Cosplay Boot Covers Tutorial</a>.</p>

## Required materials

- Cling wrap (also known as plastic wrap, Saran Wrap)
- Painter’s tape or duct tape
- Scissors
- Fabric scissors
- Large paper, such as craft paper or wrapping paper
- Marker or Sharpie
- Ruler
- Washable fabric marker or pencil
- Knit fabric with stretch
- Pins (preferably glass head)
- Sewing machine (with jersey/knit or universal needle and a bobbin full of thread to match the fabric)
- Sewing machine thread to match the knit fabric
- ¼ inch elastic

## Make a cast of your feet and legs

1. Wrap leg and foot in a minimum of one layer of cling wrap up to the knee.
2. Tape leg and foot in a minimum of one layer of painter’s or duct tape up to the knee. This creates a cast of the leg and foot.
3. Draw in desired boot decorative details on the cast where they should appear in the finished product.
4. Starting from the center knee, carefully cut the tape and cling wrap cast from the leg and foot.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the other foot. 

    <p class="callout callout-info">You may choose to skip step 5 and use the same cast for both feet, but note that when you get to the <a href="#Prepare-and-cut-fabric">Prepare and cut fabric</a> section, you must turn the pattern pieces over on the fabric to cut the mirror image.</p>

## Divide casts and label them

1. Complete the following steps for each cast.
2. Fold the tape and cling wrap cast in half, bringing the cut edges together. 
3. Cut along the center line (i.e. from the back of the knee to the back of the heel). You now have two pattern pieces.
4. Label the pattern pieces with the following information:
    - The foot and leg each pattern piece is for
    - Which part of the foot and leg each pattern piece is for (inner or outer)
    - “No seam allowance included”

        <p class="callout callout-info">For information about seam allowance, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_allowance" target="_blank">Seam allowance on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

    - Grainline with arrows pointing towards the cut edges

        <p class="callout callout-info">The grainline indicates the direction of stretch. For knit fabrics, this is the direction of greatest stretch. For woven fabrics, this is parallel to the selvedge, or the woven, non-cut edge of the fabric. For more information about grainlines, see <a href="https://www.thecuttingclass.com/grainlines/" target="_blank">A Basic Explanation of Grain Lines</a> by The Cutting Class.</p>

<h2><a name="Optional-Create-a-paper-pattern"></a>Optional: Create a paper pattern</h2>

1. Create a more permanent pattern by completing the following steps:
    1. Lay pattern pieces on large pieces of paper or light cardboard.
    2. Trace around the pattern pieces, smoothing out any lines.
    3. Use a ruler to add a seam allowance by drawing a line ½ inch (0.5 inch) around the outside of the pattern piece tracing.
    4. Cut out the paper pattern pieces by cutting on the line drawn in step 1.3.

<h2><a name="Prepare-and-cut-fabric"></a>Prepare and cut fabric</h2>

1. Lay pattern pieces on the wrong side of the fabric with the direction of greatest stretch parallel to the grainline. Do this so that the boot covers will stretch to fit your foot and leg.
2. Pin or weight the pattern pieces to keep them in place.
Use a washable fabric marker or pencil to trace the pattern pieces on the fashion fabric. Add seam allowance if you skipped [Optional: Create a paper pattern](#Optional-Create-a-paper-pattern). 
3. Optionally, draw the sewing line ½ in from the edge.
4. Cut out pattern pieces from the fashion fabric.
5. Use a washable fabric marker or pencil to label the fabric pattern pieces with the following information on the wrong side of the fabric:
    - The foot and leg each pattern piece is for
    - Which part of the foot and leg each pattern piece is for (inner or outer)
    - “½ inch seam allowance included”
    - Grainline with arrows pointing towards the cut edges

## Check and adjust fit before sewing

1. Pin fabric pieces together, wrong sides together.
Try the boot cover on. 
2. Adjust the sewing line and pins as needed to achieve a good fit. 
3. Rub the fabric pencil or marker along the new sewing line on the wrong side of the fabric.

## Pin pieces and sew

1. Pin the fabric pieces together, right sides together.
2. Using a zigzag stitch, sew from the back of the knee to the start of the heel along the sewing line.
3. Press the seam flat.
4. Open the seam and press the seam on the wrong side.
5. Turn the boot cover right side out and carefully press. If your fabric is prone to shine, place a tea towel or press cloth between the iron and the fabric.

## Complete finishing

1. Finish edges with a zigzag stitch on the sewing machine or with a serged edge using a serger. You may choose to zigzag the edges together or open. For more information on seam finishing, see [Tutorial: Six Seam Finishes & When to Use Them](https://blog.megannielsen.com/2013/03/tutorial-six-seam-finishes-and-when-to-use-them/) by Holly of Megan Nielsen.
2. To finish the top of the boot cover, you can choose one of the following options:
    - **Option 1:** Fold the top edge over ¼ inch, wrong sides together, then fold it over ¼ inch again. Pin. Topstitch close to the edge of the fold. Press.
    - **Option 2:** Sew other additional decoration (such as a strip of pleather, decorative edging, or a band of fabric) to the top edge of the boot cover, wrong sides together. Press, then press open on the wrong side. Press on the right side. Finish edge with a zigzag.
    - **Option 3:** Use Method 1 described in [How to Sew an Elastic Casing](https://sewmesomethingblog.com/how-to-sew-an-elastic-casing/) by Sew Me Something.
3. To achieve a snug fit on the foot and fully cover your shoe or boot, complete the following steps:
    - Pin and stretch elastic around the seam allowance of the unfinished foot portion of the boot cover on the wrong side.
    - Try on the boot cover with the shoe you intend to wear the boot cover with and check fit.
    - Adjust the pins and elastic as needed.
4. Using a zigzag stitch, sew the elastic to the boot cover. 
Check the fit.
5. Sew a piece of elastic across the bottom of the foot portion where the ball of the foot goes to ensure a snug fit.
