&lt;p&gt;I decided recently that I wanted to learn more about different static site generators, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a popular SSG. I selected &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes&quot;&gt;the Minimal Mistakes theme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; for hosting and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exported my existing content from Wordpress to an XML file, using the existing export tool in Wordpress. Then, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown&quot;&gt;Wordpress Export to Markdown on the command line&lt;/a&gt; to convert the XML content to separate Markdown files with YAML headers formatted appropriately for Jekyll to process the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the instructions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/&quot;&gt;the Minimal Mistakes Quick Start Guide&lt;/a&gt; to configure the top nav bar and to add front matter configurations to the main config file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will likely add different collections (I have one for poems, now), search, and a contact page later. I might add a CICD pipeline with tests. Once I am certain I have all of the content moved over from the Wordpress site, I will likely change the custom domain to this content and shut down the Wordpress site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I doing this? I have multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It seems silly to pay for site hosting when I rarely update my site–and when I do, it’s usually posts, not interactive content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wanted to see how site migration worked in this particular circumstance (Wordpress -&amp;gt; GitHub Pages using Jekyll engine).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-open-encouraging-environment&quot;&gt;Create an open, encouraging environment.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your team members to feel comfortable speaking up and suggesting solutions and alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enable-your-team&quot;&gt;Enable your team.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give your team members access to what they need to succeed, such as training, software, or time to discuss projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let them know they can always come to you with ideas, proposals, concerns, or questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;provide-timely-frequent-feedback&quot;&gt;Provide timely, frequent feedback.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t hold back with the positive feedback when team members do things that work well and have a positive impact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to deliver negative feedback:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tell the team members as soon as possible after the event that generated the negative feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Let them know the reason for the feedback and concrete, specific steps they can take to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that working with leaders who provide these things have helped me to be my best, most productive work self. When I’ve been in leadership-adjacent positions, I’ve tried to provide these things for my teammates. I’m sure my thoughts on effective leadership will evolve as I work with different people and experience different leadership styles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angelle Leger</name></author><category term="leadership" /><summary type="html">I believe solid, effective leadership must include encouragement, enablement, and timely, frequent feedback.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Always Learning: User Experience Design</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Always Learning: User Experience Design" /><published>2020-01-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently developed an interest in learning more about user experience (UX) design.

&lt;p&gt;Angelle Leger&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Is a Place Where Everyone Calls You Baby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something soft settles inside of me when I walk into my old drugstore, When I greet old women at a community function, their face powder dusty on my lips As I greet them with cheek kisses, when they say, “How you doing, baby,” The syllables drawn-out, deep with age and heavy with the ghosts of cigarettes, Warm as an electric blanket on my lap as you shiver in a shotgun house, Wind blowing through the spaces around the windows and the cracks around the doors. No one can say “baby” like an old New Orleans woman. Ba-by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, almost any place could be home, Anywhere where my grandmother was. We would be running them streets. Every summer, before the afternoon showers, we’d make groceries, Clean the used bookstores out, I’m telling you. Then the rain would come, And it would be time to put on our matching dusters and settle down, A cup of milky tea in one hand and a book with soft, browning pages in the other. This is one of the things I picture when I think of home: My grandmother laid out, all the way asleep on top of her book and her eyeglasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home is when you walk in anywhere and you are pretty sure you will see someone you know, Someone you went to high school with, maybe, or someone who’s your cousin, Your play cousin, your cousin’s cousin, or someone who used to work with your parents And met you one time when you were a baby, and every time they see you, They say, “Look how big you got!” and tell a story about that one thing you did From a time you can’t remember, but everyone remembers for you. Home is where you are a set of stories often repeated, a reputation, A conglomeration of the people who came before you. You’re so-and-so’s daughter, So-and-so’s granddaughter, so-and-so’s cousin, you know her, yeah!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angelle Leger</name></author><category term="poem" /><category term="poetry" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">I recently wrote this poem and wanted to share it here, rather than submitting it for publication elsewhere.

Learning keeps the mind sharp, and there’s a sense of accomplishment in developing new skills. I love learning how to do new things (and how to do them well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve rekindled my interest in learning more about web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning HTML when I was in high school, but stopped after entering college and switching majors. A few years ago, I attended several &lt;a href=&quot;http://neworleanswit.org/&quot;&gt;New Orleans Women in Technology&lt;/a&gt; “learn to code” workshops and started learning about (the more modern version of) HTML and CSS, but I stopped again, due to moving and changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve started learning more about HTML and CSS on my own, using online resources. I started the process recently and have learned some basics about HTML, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp&quot;&gt;W3Schools tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that a friend recommended. I took the exam to measure my progress; I &lt;a href=&quot;https://certification.w3schools.com/w3certified.asp?id=10136467&quot;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. That’s a good start, but I know there’s more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next steps involve learning more about HTML and everything about CSS. Eventually, I want to have the skills that would allow me to build a useful, responsive, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angelle Leger</name></author><category term="learning" /><summary type="html">I believe it’s important to continue to develop skills and to learn.

The courses emphasized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing concisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing for international/multicultural audiences (business writing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering writing projects on schedule and developing work timelines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use of graphics, charts, tables, and instructional illustrations in documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organization of documentation and instructional documents (such as manuals)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and so much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each course focused on building skills and techniques that the students applied to their course project. Using a type of scaffolding, weekly assignments built up to the final project and could be incorporated into the final project. The final project in each course was a researched document of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting project I did was a recommendation report about employee engagement, which included a letter of transmittal, a project timeline, a budget, research about employee engagement theories, goals, outcomes, and strategies to achieve the aforementioned goals and outcomes, and so on. The report is based on a fictional company and fictional circumstances, since it was for a class project. You can read it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelleleger.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/angelle-scott-leger_sample-recommendation-report_coursework-1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Angelle Scott Leger_Sample Recommendation Report_Coursework&quot;&gt;Sample Recommendation Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a sense of satisfaction out of the program. It allowed me to develop my skills further and to practice the skills I already had, so it was worth it in terms of professional development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angelle Leger</name></author><category term="technical-writing" /><summary type="html">I completed a technical writing certificate program in the spring.

I think that writing using dictation software are different. You have to use different thought processes to get the words on the page. Most of the time, when I speak, I don’t really think ahead about what I’m going to say. When I write, I think about what I say before I write it down. As I write, I revise. When I’m speaking, I don’t revise; however, I do stammer and stutter. I use words such as “like” and “as.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think dictation software is best used by people who have already written down the words that they wish to use. Alternately, it is good for people who actually think before they speak, which is not most of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, speaking as a different brain function for writing. Dictation software cannot fully replace writing. Dictation software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking is difficult for people with regional accents to use. Lucky for me, I have a generic accent, such as the accent that newscasters have. It is useful for people who have limited use of their hands also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to see how writing using dictation software compares to writing by hand over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Angelle Leger</name></author><summary type="html">I’m using Dragon NaturallySpeaking to write this blog post.
