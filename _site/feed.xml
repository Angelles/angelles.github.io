&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being able to read code as easily as I can read a passage written in English&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being able to understand the underlying logic and patterns of a commonly-used language, so that I can apply that same understanding to new languages as needed&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-an-open-encouraging-environment&quot;&gt;Create an open, encouraging environment.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help your team members to feel comfortable speaking up and suggesting solutions and alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enable-your-team&quot;&gt;Enable your team.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give your team members access to what they need to succeed, such as training, software, or time to discuss projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let them know they can always come to you with ideas, proposals, concerns, or questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;provide-timely-frequent-feedback&quot;&gt;Provide timely, frequent feedback.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t hold back with the positive feedback when team members do things that work well and have a positive impact.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to deliver negative feedback:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tell the team members as soon as possible after the event that generated the negative feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Let them know the reason for the feedback and concrete, specific steps they can take to improve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that working with leaders who provide these things have helped me to be my best, most productive work self. When I’ve been in leadership-adjacent positions, I’ve tried to provide these things for my teammates. I’m sure my thoughts on effective leadership will evolve as I work with different people and experience different leadership styles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="leadership" /><summary type="html">I believe solid, effective leadership must include encouragement, enablement, and timely, frequent feedback.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Always Learning: User Experience Design</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Always Learning: User Experience Design" /><published>2020-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/04/always-learning-user-experience-design.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently developed an interest in learning more about user experience (UX) design.

Learning keeps the mind sharp, and there’s a sense of accomplishment in developing new skills. I love learning how to do new things (and how to do them well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve rekindled my interest in learning more about web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning HTML when I was in high school, but stopped after entering college and switching majors. A few years ago, I attended several &lt;a href=&quot;http://neworleanswit.org/&quot;&gt;New Orleans Women in Technology&lt;/a&gt; “learn to code” workshops and started learning about (the more modern version of) HTML and CSS, but I stopped again, due to moving and changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve started learning more about HTML and CSS on my own, using online resources. I started the process recently and have learned some basics about HTML, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp&quot;&gt;W3Schools tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that a friend recommended. I took the exam to measure my progress; I &lt;a href=&quot;https://certification.w3schools.com/w3certified.asp?id=10136467&quot;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; on the first attempt. That’s a good start, but I know there’s more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next steps involve learning more about HTML and everything about CSS. Eventually, I want to have the skills that would allow me to build a useful, responsive, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/&quot;&gt;accessible&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="learning" /><summary type="html">I believe it’s important to continue to develop skills and to learn.

The courses emphasized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing concisely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;writing for international/multicultural audiences (business writing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;delivering writing projects on schedule and developing work timelines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the use of graphics, charts, tables, and instructional illustrations in documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;organization of documentation and instructional documents (such as manuals)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and so much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each course focused on building skills and techniques that the students applied to their course project. Using a type of scaffolding, weekly assignments built up to the final project and could be incorporated into the final project. The final project in each course was a researched document of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting project I did was a recommendation report about employee engagement, which included a letter of transmittal, a project timeline, a budget, research about employee engagement theories, goals, outcomes, and strategies to achieve the aforementioned goals and outcomes, and so on. The report is based on a fictional company and fictional circumstances, since it was for a class project. You can read it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://angelleleger.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/angelle-scott-leger_sample-recommendation-report_coursework-1.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Angelle Scott Leger_Sample Recommendation Report_Coursework&quot;&gt;Sample Recommendation Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a sense of satisfaction out of the program. It allowed me to develop my skills further and to practice the skills I already had, so it was worth it in terms of professional development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="technical-writing" /><summary type="html">I completed a technical writing certificate program in the spring.

I think that writing using dictation software are different. You have to use different thought processes to get the words on the page. Most of the time, when I speak, I don’t really think ahead about what I’m going to say. When I write, I think about what I say before I write it down. As I write, I revise. When I’m speaking, I don’t revise; however, I do stammer and stutter. I use words such as “like” and “as.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think dictation software is best used by people who have already written down the words that they wish to use. Alternately, it is good for people who actually think before they speak, which is not most of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, speaking as a different brain function for writing. Dictation software cannot fully replace writing. Dictation software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking is difficult for people with regional accents to use. Lucky for me, I have a generic accent, such as the accent that newscasters have. It is useful for people who have limited use of their hands also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to see how writing using dictation software compares to writing by hand over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m using Dragon NaturallySpeaking to write this blog post.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swimming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;riding a bicycle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swing dancing (lots of classes!)&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;sewing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sewing and fitting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technical writing (I’m in the last course of the certificate program right now!)&lt;/li&gt;

This post is for my young writers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to know how to improve your writing? Here’s the big tip–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, read. Read a lot! Reading a wide variety of texts at different levels of complexity, by writers who have different life experiences and opinions than you, can help you to develop a larger vocabulary, critical thinking skills, and an ear for the rhythm of words and sentences. When you hear other writers’ “flow,” you can develop your own in contrast (or in harmony).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to improve your writing, it’s better to read things that have been reviewed and edited by others for clarity and cohesiveness. Magazine articles, novels, newspaper articles, plays, short story collections–all of those are good things to read to help you hear other writers’ voices and to get a sense of how to write in those genres and forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of reading is required in many English composition classes because of the aforementioned reasons. Also, many reading assignments lead into writing assignments. If you are reading a first-person narrative essay in composition class about a time in your life when you had to make a hard decision, chances are you will be asked to write a first-person narrative essay about a time in your life when you had to make a hard decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many students who I knew were enrolled in developmental writing courses were simultaneously enrolled in developmental reading classes. It stands to reason that if you cannot read very well, in terms of comprehension and analysis, you probably will have trouble with writing. They are interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a lot and writing a lot will help you improve your writing. No one is born knowing how to write. Education and persistence are two important factors here. You can help to improve your writerly education on your own by reading and writing on your own time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="freshman-writing" /><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Well, it’s certainly not using hackneyed blog post titles that will do it!
